**Project Overview:**
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it eats food pellets, while avoiding collision with itself and the game boundaries.

**Game Features:**
-A snake that grows in length as it eats food pellets.
-The snake can move in four directions (up, down, left, right).
-The game checks for collision with itself and the game boundaries.
-The game displays the player's score.
-The game can be restarted after game over.

**How to Play:**
-Run the game by executing the Python script.
-The game window will appear with a snake and a food pellet.
-Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
-Eat the food pellets to grow the snake.
-Avoid collision with itself and the game boundaries.
-The game will display the player's score.
-If the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries, the game will end.
-Press Q to quit or C to play again.

**Code Structure:**
The code is organized into a single Python file, snake_game.py. The file contains several functions for displaying the game elements, handling user input, and updating the game state.

**Dependencies:**
-Python 3.x .
-Pygame library (install with pip install pygame).
